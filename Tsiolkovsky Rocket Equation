# 1.1 The Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation: dV= Ve ln(Mi/Mf)
print("The Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation: dV= Ve ln(Mi/Mf)")
print("This is a basic calculation to find the maximum change in velocity, or Delta V, possible for a rocket of given mass.")
# dV = rocket's change in velocity, also known as "delta V"
# Ve = exhaust velocity. Constant for a given engine; Ve = gravity accel (9.8m/s/s) times Specific Impulse
# (Specific impulse simply measures engine's efficiency, its change in momentum per unit of fuel burned)
# ln is the natural logarithm function. Gives a number we need; Details of math not important
# Mi = initial mass -- This is the total mass of all stages, the entire rocket on the launchpad, including fuel.
# Mf = Final mass of rocket -- mass after burning fuel; or, initial mass, minus fuel mass.

# Rocket parameters. Example rocket here is the Delta IV Medium 9040, used to deliver satellites to orbit.
# We will call it the "Delta 4", to avoid confusion between "Delta IV" and the variable delta V, or dV.
# The Delta 4 Medium is a basic two-stage, liquid fuel rocket.
# The second stage is stacked on top of the first stage.
# 1st stage burns, then detaches to reduce weight. Then second stage ignites.
# Because the rocket has two stages, we need two calculations to determine the total delta V.

# Delta 4 first stage parameters. Specific impulse is 245s. Initial mass 252,570kg, final mass 50,570kg
Ve = 245 * 9.8 #Exhaust velocity calculation. Specific impulse times acceleration due to gravity.
Mi = 252570 #Initial mass. 1st stage 202,000kg fuel, 26,400kg other; 2nd stage 21,320kg fuel, 2,850kg other
Mf = Mi - 202000 #Final mass after burning 1st stage fuel.

# Calculate delta V (in our equation, dV) -- this is the maximum delta V possible with our FIRST stage.
dv_stage_1 <- Ve * log(Mi/Mf)
print("Maximum change in velocity, first stage, in m/s:")
print(dv_stage_1)

# Delta 4 second stage parameters. Specific impulse is 465.5s. First stage detaches after burnout; Mi is now 24,170kg, Mf is 2,850kg
Ve2 = 465.5 * 9.8
Mi2 = 24170
Mf2 = 2850

#Calculate delta V for second stage.
dv_stage_2 <- Ve2 * log(Mi2/Mf2)
print("Maximum change in velocity, second stage, in m/s:")
print(dv_stage_2)

# But the second stage is already moving -- we want to know the total delta V for the whole rocket
dv_max <- dv_stage_1+dv_stage_2
print("Maximum delta V, total, m/s:")
print (dv_max)
